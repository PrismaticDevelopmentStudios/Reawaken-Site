        <h2>What is Reawaken?</h2>
        <p class="pt-0 pl-0 pb-0">Reawaken was founded by a survivor of a Traumatic Brain Injury, Matt. Severely injured in 2019 he was unable to work for 3 years. When he brgan appying for jobs after 2 years of recovering, no companies would hire him, inluding coffee shops that
            he applied to. In order to compensate for the large gap on his resume, Matt enrolled in a web development sourse offered by the University of Denver. Matt has met many survivors and many end up getting fired because of the deficits caused
            by their TBIs.</p>
        <p class="pt-0 pl-0">Matt decided that one way he could help get Tbi survivors back into the workforce was by creating a nonprofit coffee shop that hired TBI survivors. And so Reawken was born. A place for TBI surivors to work and to host meetings for TBI survivors
            and for anyone needing a safe space to meet. And so Reawaken was born. The name "reawaken" has two meanings. We serve coffee, which can help one to reawaken after a night's sleep. But also, many TBI survivors were in comas and had to rake
            up from their comas and recover through extensive tharapies until they are recovered enough to work again.
